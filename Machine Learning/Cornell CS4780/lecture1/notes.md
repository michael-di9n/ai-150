When this came out and beat the checkers - there was huge fevour over AI however.. it faded down because it was too early!! 


AI Winter by 1969 Minky and Papert 

Computer Science: Was logical beings 
AI: Based on statistics, optimising and logic

Supervised learning:

Require Data that are labeled (vector of features and label) they are iid (indipendant variable)

X: d dimensional vector space which will be rquired to transform the data

## Examples of Y space
e.g., 
Binary Class
- Email spam filtering (yes or no)
- Facial detection is man or female 

Multi-class CL
- What breed of doge is this
- Type of article category 

Regression:
- Y is the real numbers
